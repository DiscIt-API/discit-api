## Technologies

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MikroORM](https://mikro-orm.io/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Local Setup

Install prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (plus [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) if on Windows)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) (`npm i -g yarn`)

Also recommended:

- [Azure Data Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/developer-tools/data-studio/) (plus [PostgreSQL extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/extensions/postgres-extension?view=sql-server-ver15))

Set up environment:

- Clone repo and open root folder in VS Code.
- Install recommended VS Code extensions `Docker` and `ESLint`.
- Run `yarn install` to install package dependencies.
- Create and populate a `.env` file in the root folder and /client folder based on the respective `.env.example` files in those locations.

Set up database:

- Open Docker Desktop and leave it running in the background.
- Run `docker network create discit-dev-network` to create the Docker network.
- In VS Code, right-click on `discit-dev-container\docker-compose.yml` and select `Compose Up`.
- Run `yarn db:up` to execute the default database migration checked into source control.
  - If schema changes are subsequently made, run `yarn db:create` to generate a new migration and `yarn db:up` to execute it.

Launch:

- Run `yarn build` to compile both the server and client, and `yarn start` to start the server (client accessible at [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/)). Disc data will be fetched and automatically inserted into the database at launch (set the `FETCH_DISCS_START` .env variable to `false` to disable this), and also every night at midnight via cron job (set the `FETCH_DISCS_CRON` .env variable to `false` to disable this).
  - Alternatively, start the `debug` launch configuration in VS Code (press `F5`), which essentially runs `yarn dev` and attaches a debugger to the back end (building not required).
